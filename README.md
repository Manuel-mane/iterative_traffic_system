# iterative_traffic_system
Capstone 2 Project, part of the bachelor program of Telecommunications Technology Engineering

This is 6 month project based on Arduino platform. The development of the software went through different stages till his final version. This code is prone to improvement
but requires the meeting of many criterias

The objectives of this project were:

⦁	Development of a traffic and street rail system that will be able to read real-time traffic conditions and makes the necessary adjustments to alleviate congestions
and improve the traffic flow. 

⦁	Development of an interface for first-responders that will allow them to communicate with the system and to override street-way directions and traffic signaling
conditions.

⦁	Development of a train-crossroad system that will include an emergency module. This safety mechanism will trigger in the event a vehicle or object blocks the crossroad
as a train approaches. 


Requirements:

- Arduino IDE

- ESP 32 and Drivers

- Arduino Mega 2560 and drivers

- Electronic components: LED, LCD, resistors, connectors, Relays, Servo Motors

- More details in the documentation
